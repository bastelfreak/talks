## Abstract

Vox Pupuli is a group of more than 80 puppet module/tooling/documentation
authors, all working together to ensure a continuing development process. We
elected our first Project Management Committee with one of its goals being to
include Vox Pupuli as an official project under the Software Conservancy. We do
not only provide a home for every orphaned puppet module, but also proper
tooling and automation for every interested developer. Some of the most
frequently used puppet modules (zabbix, collectd, archive, extlib) are managed
by us. Have a look at our funny journey of hunting broken gems and changing
upstream software! We invite everybody to participate. We will get into the
details of what Vox Pupuli is, how you can interact/contribute/benefit and also
we will share some funny and sad stories about all the bugs we discovered in
the Puppet and Ruby ecosystem!
