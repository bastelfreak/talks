# Open Source Summit 2025

## Vox Pupuli - Behind every successful open source project is a vibrant community

## Description

What happens when critical open source projects stop being maintained?

Vox Pupuli is a group of more than 220 puppet module/tooling/documentation authors, all working together to ensure a continuing development process. Our goal is to adopt abandoned FOSS projects from the Puppet ecosystem and to unite lonely FOSS developers.

Contributors expect fast feedback for issues and pull request and the time from every maintainer for reviews is very limited. In this talk we will do a deep dive into what Vox Pupuli is, how we build the community and keep it running! We will also discuss how we manage contributions at large scale.

We invite everybody to participate. We will get into the details about how you can interact/contribute/benefit. We will also tell you some stories about all the awesome stuff that's happening in the community that creates a very welcoming place for people!

## Presented this talk before?

I year ago I presented an older version at the puppet.run (https://puppet.run/) conference in Germany: https://bastelfreak.de/puppetrun/#1

For the Open Source Summit, I want to present a new version of the talk (after the great Perforce exodus https://www.puppet.com/blog/open-source-puppet-updates-2025 )

## What topics would you be available to discuss?

Building open source communities, handling customer vs user vs commercial companies interests in a project. Scaling organisations.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

Establishing a sustainable open source project is hard. Many projects start with a single person and a great idea. How do you establish the project, how do you grow your project and unite more developers/participants/contributors?

Vox Pupuli ( https://voxpupuli.org/) managed that over the past decade, with now over 220 people. I want to tell you our story, so you can benefit from it!
