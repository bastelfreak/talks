# Puppet hacks you didn't know you were looking for

* Ever needed to debug a Puppet agent run but didn't find the right path?
* Tired of maintaing excel sheets with servers and service now is too expensive?
* Your puppetserver has a hiccup every 30 minutes? Or every week?
* You need to create clusters but manual firewall changes for every node are too time consuming?

This talk is for you! We will go through all the hidden gems of cli commands and
puppet concects you won't find in the documentation. And we will talk about
tuning and debugging your puppetserver(s)
