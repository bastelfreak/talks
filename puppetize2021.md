# Why Open Source brings more value to business?

## Abtract

Why should companies use open source Puppet modules?
Why should they contribute to open source projects and even publish home-grown modules?

Many companies like to use open source software but prefer to keep their own code in-house. They think their business is more secure if they keep their code private. But that's not true!
This talk will focus on all the aspects about open source (with a focus on Puppet modules) in companies, how it increases the security about the platforms, brings you happier engineers and reduced onboarding time for new hires!
