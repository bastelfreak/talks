## Abstract

> Everybody loves Prometheus. Many exporters are available to gather specific data. You can download the binaries from GitHub, start them and they will expose data via plain HTTP, without any firewalling or authentication. That would just complicate the whole setup!

This is how the usual installation guide looks. It works, but it doesn't cover
all the important parts a systems engineer loves.

* What about authentication?
* What about firewalling?
* How can we make the Prometheus server aware of the exporters?
* How do we integrate custom applications that also provide prometheus compatible metrics?

A secure and automated rollout of exporters isn't easy. Also an authenticated
connection from the prometheus server to the exporters requires some
preparation. This talk will cover a proper concept and all details to rollout
multiple exporters to many systems, completely automated with Puppet.

The git repository does not only contain the source for the presentation and the
pdf. It also contains Puppet code and a Vagrantfile to spin up a test
environment for everything shown in the talk.
