## Abstract

Everybody loves Prometheus. Many exporters are available to gather specific data. You can download the binaries from GitHub, start them and they will expose data via plain HTTP, without any firewalling or authentication. That would just complicate the whole setup!

A secure and automated rollout of exporters isn't easy. Also an authenticated connection from the prometheus server to the exporters requires some preparation. This talk will cover a proper concept and all details to rollout multiple exporters to many systems, completely automated with Puppet.
