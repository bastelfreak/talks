# title

Deploying workshop instances in cloud using terraform, Puppet and Bolt

## brief description

How Terraform, Bolt & Puppet can provide reproducible workshop- and test environments

## short abstract

Workshops and training sessions are essential for people to learn and understand complex technologies and its concepts. When providing workshops, we use cloud instances, so we can be sure that everyone works in the same environment.

In this demo, Tim will be spinning up some cloud instances. This will be done with terraform. The configuration of the instances will be done with Puppet. Tim will demo how to combine Puppet and Terraform for easy automation and also show a Puppet technology training environment.

## long abstract

Developers are often faced with the challenge to reproduce bugs or to create an environment where multiple developers can work on. This is tricky with local environments on laptops/workstations.

System administrators often need to evaluate new software stacks, provide workshops for coworkers or test upgrades.

Terraform is an awesome tool to provision cloud resources, Bolt is an orchestration tool to kick of onetime jobs and Puppet is perfect to enforce a system state. We will show how these three tools can be combined to fulfill all developer and system administrators dreams!

## message to the reviewers

Hi!
I'm Tim, a member of Vox Pupuli. We are a (non profit) open source organisation within the Puppet ecosystem. I would like to present how our organisation works, how we scale and what other companys and orgs can learn from it. I mad similar talks at previous puppet conferences, but not with identical content.
I'm living in europe and a trip to the US is expensive, I'm currently discussing this with potential sponsors. I'm quite sure that I will be able to attend (if you accept the CFP), but I am not 100% sure yet. I hope to clear this out within the next two weeks.

I also submitted a talk with the title "Vox Pupuli - Behind every successful open source project is a vibrant community". I'm happy to do both talks if you like. If only one fits in the schedule, I recommend "How Terraform, Bolt & Puppet can provide reproducible workshop- and test environments".
