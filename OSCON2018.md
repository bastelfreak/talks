## Abstract

What happens when critical open source projects stop being maintained?

Vox Pupuli is a group of more than 120 puppet module/tooling/documentation authors, all working together to ensure a continuing development process. Our goal is to adopt abandoned FOSS projects from the Puppet ecosystem and to unite lonely FOSS developers.

In this talk we take a deep dive in what it takes to rescue abandoned open source projects, their dependencies, and their communities. Vox Pupuli offers proper tooling and automation for every interested developer. Some of the most frequently used puppet modules (zabbix, collectd, archive, yum, nginx) are managed by us. Vox Pupuli is in the Top 10 of the most frequent Puppet Forge release groups. Have a look at our funny journey of hunting broken gems and changing upstream software!

We invite everybody to participate. We will get into the details about how you can interact/contribute/benefit. We will also tell you some stories about all the awesome stuff that's happening in the community that creates a very welcoming place for people!

## What's the takeaway for the audience?

* How to become a better developer by participating in a community
* What is Vox Pupuli, which value does it provide to a company using Puppet and how can Users benefit from the community

## Prerequisite knowledge for this presentation

It's helpful if the attendees know what Infrastructure as code is and how a git workflow could look like. The talk is designed for people that:

I gave talks in the past with the same or similar title. The purpose was always to represent the community. But the content I planned for this specific talk wasn't presented yet and is completely new.
