## Topic

Open Source

## Abstract

Vox Pupuli is a group of more than 120 puppet module/tooling/documentation authors, all working together to ensure a continuing development process. In 2016 we elected our first Project Management Committee with one of its goals being to include Vox Pupuli as an official project under the Software Conservancy and to guide the community.

We do not only provide a home for every orphaned puppet module; we also offer proper tooling and automation for every interested developer. Some of the most frequently used puppet modules (zabbix, collectd, archive, yum, nginx) are managed by us. Vox Pupuli is in the Top 10 of the most frequent Puppet Forge release groups. Have a look at our funny journey of hunting broken gems and changing upstream software!

We invite everybody to participate. We will get into the details of what Vox Pupuli is and how you can interact/contribute/benefit. We will also tell you some stories about all the awesome stuff that's happening in the community that creates a very welcoming place for people!

## What's the takeaway for the audience?

* How to become a better developer by participating in a community
* What is Vox Pupuli, which value does it provide to a company using Puppet and how can Users benefit from the community

I gave talks in the past with the same or similar title. The purpose was always to represent the community. But the content I planned for this specific talk wasn't presented yet and is completely new.
