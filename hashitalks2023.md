## Session title

How to automate and use Consul, Vault and Nomad with Puppet!

## Description

Consul for service registry/discovery, Vault for secret handling and Nomad for running jobs - those tools are well known and there are a lot of tutorials for hosting them in the cloud or spinning up (insecure) development environments. But how do you provision them on-premise? How do you provision them *in a secure way* (hint: piping curl output into a shell isn't a valid answer)?

Puppet is an open source configuration management system. We will use it to provision Consul, Vault and Nomad clusters and also show examples on how Puppet can not only install them, but also use them to configure our monitoring, provide secrets to other systems and spin up jobs.
