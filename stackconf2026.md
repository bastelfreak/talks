## One year OpenVoxProject - State of the Puppet ecosystem after the Perforce exodus

At the End of 2024, Perforce announced to stop doing open source work and switch Puppet to a closed source license. The Community decided to continue the open source development - with great success.
How did users and the community deal with the sudden license change? How do we built a sustainable community that can carry on the workload, and how can other ecosystems prevent this in the future?
I want to provide a deep dive about achievements from the OpenVoxProject within the one year,  and I want to give an overview about upcoming topics and possible ways to engage and support the community!
