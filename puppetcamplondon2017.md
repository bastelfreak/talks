## Bio

Tim (bastelfreak) Meusel works as a Systems Engineer at GoDaddy EMEA in Cologne, Germany where he develops and maintains a big public cloud platform. Tim is pushing and implementing open source solutions at work. He founded the VirtAPI-Stack and besides that he is active as a Vox Pupuli Maintainer and Archlinux community manager. Tim has been doing Sysops stuff since 2009 and playing with Puppet since 2012. Recently he was elected to serve on the Vox Pupuli Project Management Committee. He enjoys good BBQ and ice hockey.

## Abstract

Vox Pupuli is a group of more than 120 puppet module/tooling/documentation authors, all working together to ensure a continuing development process. We elected our first Project Management Committee with one of its goals being to include Vox Pupuli as an official project under the Software Conservancy. We do not only provide a home for every orphaned puppet module, but also proper tooling and automation for every interested developer. Some of the most frequently used puppet modules (zabbix, collectd, archive, extlib) are managed by us. Vox Pupuli is in the Top 10 of the most frequent Puppet Forge release groups. Have a look at our funny journey of hunting broken gems and changing upstream software! We invite everybody to participate. We will get into the details of what Vox Pupuli is, how you can interact/contribute/benefit and also we will share some funny and sad stories about all the bugs we discovered in the Puppet and Ruby ecosystem and how we migrated 80 modules to Puppet 4!

Hellooooo Kara.
I submitted the same proposal for puppetconf, and I made a smaller talk a few months back on the config management camp:

However, there are several updates and more details that I could present now.
