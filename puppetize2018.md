## Session 1 Details

* Title: Vox Pupuli - The Community behind Puppet

Vox Pupuli is a group of more than 120 puppet module/tooling/documentation
authors, all working together to ensure a continuing development process. In
2016 we elected our first Project Management Committee with one of its goals
being to include Vox Pupuli as an official project under the Software
Conservancy and to guide the community. We do not only provide a home for every
orphaned puppet module, but also proper tooling and automation for every
interested developer. Some of the most frequently used puppet modules (zabbix,
collectd, archive, yum, nginx) are managed by us. Vox Pupuli is in the Top 10
of the most frequent Puppet Forge release groups. Have a look at our funny
journey of hunting broken gems and changing upstream software! We invite
everybody to participate. We will get into the details of what Vox Pupuli is,
how you can interact/contribute/benefit and also we will share some funny and
sad stories about all the bugs we discovered in the Puppet and Ruby ecosystem!

## Session 2 Details

* Title: Vox Pupuli  - Managing 150 git repositories and contributions at scale

Managing a single FOSS project is hard. You get a ton of of emails from GitHub
issues, contributions and people asking for new releases. And every other month
your build pipeline fails because one of your project's dependencies introduced
a breaking change. Now think about the amount of issues you would have with
multiple repos! Vox Pupuli, the community managing over 100 Puppet modules and
over 150 git repositories, developed some tooling and best practices to handle
the huge amount of repositories and contributions. We would like to introduce
you to our way of organizing a FOSS community and share some funny stories
about the issues and outages that forced us to develop and improve our tooling.
