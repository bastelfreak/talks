# Foreman Birthday Party 2025

https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-birthday-event-2025/42996

## Abstract:

```
Hi,

If you've still a free slot, I would like to talk about migrating from
PE to Open Source (and also
https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-integrating-bolt-into-remote-execution/39901).


Rough abstract: For historic (or whatever) reasons, some big companies
pay for Puppet Enterprise. With the license and EULA change from
Perforce, many of those companies are unhappy and want to move away. In
this talk I provide insights in what PE actually is, how people can
migrate and how Foreman can benefit from it.
```
