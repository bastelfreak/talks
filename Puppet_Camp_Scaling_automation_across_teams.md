# Puppet Camp: Scaling automation across teams

Conference URL: https://puppet.com/events/scaling-automation-across-teams/

## Talk title

You thought scaling infra is hard, try scaling team contributions!

## Talk Abstract or Description

Running a large infrastructure isn't easy. But how do you handle contributions from multiple teams or many individuals? Contributors expect fast feedback for issues and pull request and the time from every maintainer/reviews is very limited. Vox Pupuli is a Puppet focused community that maintains over 140 modules and over 20 gems. The talk will guide you through the challenges that Vox Pupuli surfaced and how they are solving it. You will learn how Vox Pupuli works and how the workflows can be adopted to other Open Source communitys and also company-internal teams.
