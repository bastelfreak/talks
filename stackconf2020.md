## Title

Vox Pupuli Tasks - How the Puppet community enhances the reviewer workflow by using the GitHub API

## Level

Advanced

## Submision Abstract

Vox Pupuli maintains over 160 git repositories and utilizes GitHub heavily for maintenance and daily tasks. We've built an app to support all the module maintainers in their daily work.

Vox Pupuli Tasks (VPT) is an web application which summarizes various information for easy access about modules which need some attention. This helps the maintainers to focus more on the actual work rather then figuring out where attention is missing. Also VPT uses the Github API to create comments and monitors open pull requests to notify their authors about things they may have forgotten (merge conflicts, outdated states). We also have big plans for the tool and want to bring some attention to it and find out what could be added or changed to enhance it more and more. See [our GitHub project](https://github.com/voxpupuli/vox-pupuli-tasks#vox-pupuli-tasks---the-webapp-for-community-management) if you are curious about the code or contributing.

In this talk you will learn how the Puppet Community works, how we improve the live of our reviewsers/members and what we can automate with GitHub events.
