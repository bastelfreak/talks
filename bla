Who likes to do major upgrades of a distribution that got installed years ago
and since then got no love? Nobody. Who needs to rely on third party repos or
package stuff themself because the packages provided by the distributions are too
old?

Not all of us can run their applications in minimalistic containers. Sometimes
we still require traditional operating systems on physical or virtual machines.
Archlinux is a rolling release distribution. It allows us to continuously
upgrade the system. I will walk you through the GoDaddy EMEA way of running and
updating Archlinux on production systems. Including dynamic provisioning of
test- and staging-environments. All tested with Beaker and managed with Puppet.
There are multiple advantages compared to classic Debian/RHEL deployments that
I want to share and discuss with you. Discover if Archlinux is the datacenter
distribution you were looking for!
