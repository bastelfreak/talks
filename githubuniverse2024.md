## Title

Vox Pupuli: How did we build a successful open source community?

## Abstract

What happens when critical open source projects aren't maintained anymore?

Vox Pupuli is a group of over 200 individuals, maintaining over 300 projects in
the Puppet ecosystem. We all are working together to ensure a continuing
development process. Our goal is to adopt abandoned FOSS projects from the
Puppet ecosystem and to unite lonely FOSS developers.

In this talk we will do a deep dive into how we build the community and keep it
running and why you should participate! We will also discuss how we manage
contributions at large scale and how we prevent the next xz desaster!

## A detailed outline of your proposed session

Vox Pupuli is a very diverse group. We are spread across the whole globe. This
means:

* Spread across different timezones
* Everybody is a volunteer. So the amount of available time per person per week varies a lot
* Everybody has a different cultural background
* Everybody has a different technical background
* Everybody has a different motivation for contributing

We learned that we are basically the most complicated remote-first company you can
imagine. You cannot predict who is available when. But something unites us: we
all aim for a better code quality and a continuous development.

Somehow Vox Pupuli managed to be successful and to even grow over time (from 75
members to over 200 now).

We learned how to make decisions in such an environment, how to document them
and how to do separation of concerns. In the talk I will try to explain how we
do this and how we use GitHub and why GitHub helps us.

The audience will learn how to scale CI setups (as in: how to handle a huge
amount of PRs). They will also get an understanding of how successful remote
work is possible and how they can adopt it for their own professional work.

call-to-action: Solo developers in the audience should consider to join or form
collective. Also everybody can rethink how they communicate within their company
and maybe adopt any of the Vox Pupuli patterns. Or they even join Vox Pupuli.

This talk is the perfect fit for the DevX track. The whole talk is about the
developer experience within Vox Pupuli and how others can adopt it to their
projects and companies.

Visual Aids: The talk will use slides with multiple graphs/charts.

## DevEx Track

What does developer experience mean to you? Less friction, more productivity?
Finding more time for creativity, collaboration, and innovation? How do you
stay in the flow? How do you leverage GitHub’s platform and features? We are
looking for industry experts and impactful practitioners who are driving
collaboration, simplifying tech stacks, reducing onboarding times, and
prioritizing developer-first security for the betterment of their teams, their
customers, their careers, and their communities.
