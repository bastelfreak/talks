Note to organizers:
    
The panel format is a good match for discussion and information about VoxPupuli. In many ways we are still figuring out our practices, standards, and policies. If one person gave a lecture style presentation on this content, they would be given 'the power of the pen' and it would not be driven by consensus. With this format different voxpupuli contributors can give different answers, presenting a more accurate and nuanced view into some of these issues.
