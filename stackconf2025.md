# Vox Pupuli - State of the Puppet ecosystem after the exodus

## Abstract

Vox Pupuli is a Puppet focused community. The goal is to unite lonely module and tooling authors to provide a home for orphaned modules and to ensure a continued development of the code base.

End of 2024, Perforce Inc, the owner of "puppet", announced to drop their open source work.

Vox Pupuli stepped up and is now the upstream source and provides packages.

In this talk I will inform you about Vox Pupuli, why it's successful and how we managed to to become the upstream organisation for widely used puppet agent/server/db.
