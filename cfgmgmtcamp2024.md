# Configuration Management Camp 2024

## Vox Pupuli - Community Update (Ignite talk)

## Abstract

Vox Pupuli is a Puppet focused community. The goal is to unite lonely module and tooling authors to provide a home for orphaned modules and to ensure a continued development of the code base. In this ignite we will inform you about the state of Vox Pupuli, our growth and that we accept funding now (and how you can sponsor us)!
